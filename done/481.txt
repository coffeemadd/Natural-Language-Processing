       The Friend21 Project is a MITI sponsored effort to
       develop a comfortable personal information system
       for the 21st century.  A major concern is the user
       interface, and one approach under current study is
       the development of rich interface agents.  This talk
       will discuss the user interface for Friend21 and
       <location>present recent progress toward the project's goals.</location>
