<paragraph><sentence>Assembly problems arise when a robot with relatively few degrees of actuated
freedom is assigned to manipulate an environment with relatively  many
degrees of unactuated freedom.</sentence><sentence>This talk reviews our progress in the
effort to pose and solve classes of such problems within a framework of
"autonomous machine design" that emphasizes the dynamical nature of
robot tasks and environments.</sentence></paragraph>
