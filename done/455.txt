 LabSpace:  Developing the National Electronic Laboratory Infrastructure

The LabSpace project integrates emerging multiuser virtual
environment technology with state of the art multimedia interfaces in
order to support scientific collaboration.  The resulting networked
environment, composed of a persistent collection of objects and a
flexible history mechanism, allows the creation of electronic virtual
laboratories.  These virtual laboratories will be networked locations
where scientists will interact with analytical electron microscopes,
high energy physics experiments and data, and, most importantly, each
other.  The LabSpace project will develop the tools to create these
virtual laboratories and the scientists' interfaces, and will
validate these integrated tools in two end-user testbeds.
